# AWSTesting

This code project is something that I was trying out with an iOS AWS SDK.  

So far, this project lays the foundation of some basic AWS Cognito Auth / Auth Portal through iOS.

Future aims for this project include testing POST and GET functionality via AWS Lambda in concurrence with AWS DynamoDB and Amazon S3.

I also have plans to explore Serverless Application Model's for the AWS backend.
